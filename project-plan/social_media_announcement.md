I started this project to help a visually impaired family member. They needed a way to "read" books and docs without relying on others.
Existing tools were either too expensive 💸 or too complicated.

So I built this:
✅ **Lightweight:** Native Windows app (no bloat).
✅ **Powerful:** Converts PDFs, Markdown, & Text to detailed audio.

It gives you the premium quality of paid services, for free.

### Option 1: The "Milestone & Mission" Post (Best for Reach)
**BIG UPDATE: I’ve officially released the Lightweight Windows Version of my Vietnamese TTS project! 🚀**

This is more than just a software update; it’s a personal mission.

**The "Why"** ❤️
I originally started this project to help a visually impaired family member. They needed a way to independently "read" news, books, and documents.
I looked at the market and saw two options: **Expensive subscriptions** or **Complicated dev tools**.

**The Solution** 🛠️
I decided to build something better. Today's update brings a fully native, **Lightweight Windows Application** that solves the problem instantly.

**What's New in This Version:**
✅ **Native Performance:** Built with Tkinter for instant startup and low memory usage.
✅ **Drag & Drop:** Easily convert PDFs, Markdown, and Text files to MP3.
✅ **Accessibility First:** Simple UI designed for ease of use.

**Free vs. Paid** 💸
Unlike services that charge you per minute or month, this tool is **100% Free and Open Source**. It leverages high-quality Edge TTS voices to provide a premium listening experience without the premium price tag.

Accessibility should be free.

### Option 2: The "Technical & Personal" Blend
**Can a side project solve a real-life problem? Yes.**

Today I'm pushing a **Major Update** to my Vietnamese Text-to-Speech project: **The Lightweight Windows App**.

**The Backstory:**
My family member is visually impaired. "Reading" standard documents was a struggle. I wanted to give them (and others like them) a tool to convert any text—PDFs, stories, articles—into natural-sounding audio.

**Technically speaking**, I wanted it to be:
1.  **Lightweight:** No heavy frameworks (Electron, etc.). Just native, snappy Python.
2.  **Robust:** capable of handling complex document formats.
3.  **Free:** To ensure anyone can use it.

**The Result:**
A simple executable that rivals paid formatting tools. You get high-quality AI voices, unlimited conversion, and zero friction.

If you are tired of monthly fees for TTS tools, give this a try.
